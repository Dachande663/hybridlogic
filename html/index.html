				<h3><a href="#">The Cliff <small>23 Aug 2015</small></a></h3>
				<p>I call it the Cliff, but it could just as well be a mountain. An inevitable point that I reach with all projects that I undertake on my own time. I start with gusto, after the initial paralysis on choosing which of the thousand different options to use. I get a good run at the problem. Start adding modules, functionality and UI springing up and all is good with the world.</p>

				<h3><a href="#">Naga Links <small>22 Aug 2015</small></a></h3>
				<p>This week has been pretty damn interesting at work. There are new plans in place and projects in the pipeline that are the kind of things a geek like me lives for. So I celebrated by having a curry with the family and am now paying for having a ghost chilli jalfrezi. Anyway, a mixed set of links this week (as ever, they got more techy the further down you go).</p>

				<h3><a href="#">Fliegen <small>9 Jul 2015</small></a></h3>
				<p>I love flying. And not just because it takes me to awesome places around the world. I love flying because it’s safe and because it’s computerised.</p>

			<p><a href="#">Sharding Pinterest: How we scaled our MySQL fleet</a> – My biggest takeaway from all of this? Sometimes it’s the simplest solutions that are the best. MySQL is well known and companies like Google and Facebook have shown it can grow to incredible scale.</p>
			<p><a href="#">Parens of the Dead</a> – Wanna learn you a lisp for great good? Why not have some fun while you’re at it.</p>
			<p><a href="#">imba</a> – I think their proposition sums it up best. Take Ruby and React and smash ‘em together. I wouldn’t touch this myself as I can’t see it ever getting past the point of “interesting weekend project” for 99% of people.</p>
			<p><a href="#">Falcor</a> – Having spent the past few months working on very content-heavy sites, I can attest to the fact that data is the only thing that matters in a system. Falcor looks like a nice route for getting what you need, quickly and with minimal fuss.</p>
