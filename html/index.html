				<h3><a href="#">The Cliff <small>23 Aug 2015</small></a></h3>
				<p>I call it the Cliff, but it could just as well be a mountain. An inevitable point that I reach with all projects that I undertake on my own time. I start with gusto, after the initial paralysis on choosing which of the thousand different options to use. I get a good run at the problem. Start adding modules, functionality and UI springing up and all is good with the world.</p>

				<h3><a href="#">Naga Links <small>22 Aug 2015</small></a></h3>
				<p>This week has been pretty damn interesting at work. There are new plans in place and projects in the pipeline that are the kind of things a geek like me lives for. So I celebrated by having a curry with the family and am now paying for having a ghost chilli jalfrezi. Anyway, a mixed set of links this week (as ever, they got more techy the further down you go).</p>

				<h3><a href="#">Fliegen <small>9 Jul 2015</small></a></h3>
				<p>I love flying. And not just because it takes me to awesome places around the world. I love flying because it’s safe and because it’s computerised.</p>

				<h3><a href="#">I Spent My Weekend Shooting Nazis on the Moon with a Laser Gun and it was Glorious <small>8 Jun 2015</small></a></h3>
				<p>Back when I was 11, I vividly remember getting Syphon Filter 2 for the PlayStation. I played that game for 11 straight hours, taking only short pauses to eat and defecate. It’s been a long time since I’ve done that.</p>

			<div class="list__item"><a href="#">imba</a> – I think their proposition sums it up best. Take Ruby and React and smash ‘em together. I wouldn’t touch this myself as I can’t see it ever getting past the point of “interesting weekend project” for 99% of people.</div>
			<div class="list__item"><a href="#">Falcor</a> – Having spent the past few months working on very content-heavy sites, I can attest to the fact that data is the only thing that matters in a system. Falcor looks like a nice route for getting what you need, quickly and with minimal fuss.</div>
